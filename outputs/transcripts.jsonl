{"speaker": "interviewer", "message": "## Functional Specification: Especificación funcional para el portal de gestión de ventas y soporte\n\n**1. Project Overview & Objectives**\nEl proyecto tiene como objetivo implementar un portal intuitivo que centralice los procesos de ventas y soporte, reduzca fricciones operativas, elimine flujos duplicados y disminuya los tickets de soporte, respetando las normativas regionales de retención de datos.\n\n*   **Project Objective:** Optimizar la gestión de ventas y soporte mediante un portal centralizado que unifique flujos operativos, automatice tareas repetitivas y ofrezca métricas clave para decisiones estratégicas.\n\n**2. Scope Boundaries:**\nDesarrollar un portal que elimine procesos redundantes, permita un autoservicio eficiente y facilite la sincronización de datos entre sistemas existentes.\n\n*   **In-Scope:** - Integración con Salesforce, Power BI, RR.HH. y sistemas financieros.\n- Automatización de solicitudes y tareas repetitivas.\n- Implementación de reportes sobre indicadores clave e informes automatizados.\n- Capacitación clara y materiales para usuarios clave.\n*   **Out-of-Scope:** - Funcionalidades avanzadas de personalización de reportes para usuarios en la fase inicial.\n- Soporte a sistemas externos no mencionados, salvo en próximas fases del proyecto.\n\n**3. Current State (As-Is)**\n\n*   Sales and support processes are fragmented across multiple unsynchronized tools.\n*   High volume of support tickets is caused by repetitive inquiries and lack of self-service.\n*   Duplicate processes across business units create inefficiencies and employee burnout.\n\n**As-Is Process Flows**\n\n*   **Support Ticket Management:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customers manually submit a ticket to the support team.\n        * 2. The support team reviews and categorizes the request.\n        * 3. An agent is assigned to address the ticket.\n        * 4. The agent resolves the issue and closes the ticket.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Insufficient information provided in the initial ticket submission.\n        * 2. Duplicate tickets arise due to lack of consolidation mechanisms.\n*   **Sales Report Creation:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Data is manually gathered from various sources.\n        * 2. Users consolidate data into a local file.\n        * 3. The regional management team receives manually created reports.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Data errors occur due to inconsistent formats during consolidation.\n        * 2. Manual processes lead to long turnaround times for report generation.\n\n![AS-IS Process Diagram](diagrams\\as-is_support-ticket-management_20251217_151137.svg)\n\n![AS-IS Process Diagram](diagrams\\as-is_sales-report-creation_20251217_151137.svg)\n\n**4. Future State (To-Be)**\n\n*   Centralize sales and support operations within an intuitive, unified portal.\n*   Enable efficient self-service for end customers to reduce repetitive support tickets.\n*   Automate repetitive tasks and eliminate duplicated processes across business units.\n*   Provide real-time automated reporting with actionable KPIs.\n*   Seamlessly integrate with Salesforce, Power BI, HR, and financial systems.\n*   Ensure compliance with regional data retention regulations and secure integrations.\n\n**Future Process Flows**\n\n*   **Automated Ticket Management:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customer submits a ticket via the self-service portal.\n        * 2. The system checks for duplicate tickets based on key validations.\n        * 3. Requests are categorized automatically by type and priority.\n        * 4. Support team is notified only if manual intervention is needed.\n        * 5. Tickets resolved automatically in the system are closed promptly.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Missing or incomplete data prevents accurate ticket categorization.\n        * 2. Duplicate tickets occur due to system misconfiguration during integration.\n*   **Automated Sales Report Generation:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Salesforce and Power BI data are synchronized in real time.\n        * 2. The portal consolidates data per defined business rules.\n        * 3. Reports with key metrics are generated automatically.\n        * 4. Reports are distributed electronically to relevant managers.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Partial data synchronization results in incomplete reports.\n        * 2. Regional data retention rules cause delays in report generation.\n*   **Elimination of Process Redundancies:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. System identifies and flags duplicate workflows across business units.\n        * 2. Affected processes are streamlined based on defined rules.\n        * 3. Consolidated workflows are deployed with clear documentation.\n        * 4. Employees are trained on the updated, unified workflows.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Legacy system compatibility issues block redundancy elimination.\n        * 2. Resistance to workflow changes leads to inconsistent process adoption.\n*   **Self-Service Enablement for Support:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Self-service options are presented to customers on the portal.\n        * 2. Knowledge base articles provide clear answers to common inquiries.\n        * 3. Customer resolves the issue without raising a ticket.\n        * 4. Feedback is logged automatically to improve self-service accuracy.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Knowledge base lacks sufficient information for resolution.\n        * 2. Misclassification of self-service data increases unresolved inquiries.\n\n![TO-BE Process Diagram](diagrams\\to-be_automated-ticket-management_20251217_151139.svg)\n\n![TO-BE Process Diagram](diagrams\\to-be_automated-sales-report-generation_20251217_151139.svg)\n\n![TO-BE Process Diagram](diagrams\\to-be_elimination-of-process-redundancies_20251217_151139.svg)\n\n![TO-BE Process Diagram](diagrams\\to-be_self-service-enablement-for-support_20251217_151139.svg)\n\n**5. Stakeholders & Personas**\n\n*   **Representante de Ventas:** Usuario principal que necesita herramientas ágiles para automatizar tareas repetitivas y gestionar clientes de forma eficiente.\n*   **Equipo de Soporte:** Encargado de atender tickets y consultas, requiere procesos simplificados y flujos claros de autoservicio.\n*   **Gerente Regional:** Usuario con acceso a reportes estratégicos para supervisión y toma de decisiones basadas en métricas clave.\n\n**6. Functional Requirements Overview**\nEl portal automatiza la gestión de ventas y soporte, elimina duplicidades, ofrece autoservicio al cliente y proporciona reportes en tiempo real mientras asegura el cumplimiento normativo.\n\n**7.
