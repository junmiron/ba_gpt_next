Customer submits a ticket via the self-service portal.\n        * 2. The system checks for duplicate tickets based on key validations.\n        * 3. Requests are categorized automatically by type and priority.\n        * 4. Support team is notified only if manual intervention is needed.\n        * 5. Tickets resolved automatically in the system are closed promptly.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Missing or incomplete data prevents accurate ticket categorization.\n        * 2. Duplicate tickets occur due to system misconfiguration during integration.\n*   **Automated Sales Report Generation:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Salesforce and Power BI data are synchronized in real time.\n        * 2. The portal consolidates data per defined business rules.\n        * 3. Reports with key metrics are generated automatically.\n        * 4. Reports are distributed electronically to relevant managers.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Partial data synchronization results in incomplete reports.\n        * 2. Regional data retention rules cause delays in report generation.\n*   **Elimination of Process Redundancies:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. System identifies and flags duplicate workflows across business units.\n        * 2. Affected processes are streamlined based on defined rules.\n        * 3.
