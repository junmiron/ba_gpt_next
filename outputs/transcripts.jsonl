Current State (As-Is)**\n\n*   Onboarding cases are manually created and updated across CRM and support systems, causing delays and data inconsistencies.\n*   Support agents lack real-time visibility into case status, leading to redundant follow-ups and slower resolution.\n*   KPIs are reported monthly, delaying feedback and reducing responsiveness to performance issues.\n*   Escalations for overdue cases rely on manual monitoring, often resulting in delays beyond 72 hours.\n*   Role-based access is inconsistently enforced, with agents sometimes accessing unauthorized customer data.\n\n**As-Is Process Flows**\n\n*   **Case Resolution Workflow:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customer submits onboarding request via web form\n        * 2. Support agent manually creates case in CRM\n        * 3. Agent resolves issue during first contact\n        * 4. Case status updated in CRM and analytics platform\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Agent lacks access to required customer data due to role restrictions\n        * 2. CRM API latency delays case creation or update\n        * 3. No automated escalation for cases exceeding 72 hours\n        * 4. Manual tracking leads to missed follow-ups and delayed resolution\n\n![AS-IS Process Diagram](as-is_case-resolution-workflow_20251121_163334.svg)\n\n**4. Future State (To-Be)**\n\n*   Onboarding cases auto-create in CRM and sync across Salesforce, Okta, and Segment within 15 minutes of submission.\n*   Support agents get real-time alerts and role-based dashboards showing assigned cases and resolution guidance.\n*   Cases exceeding 72 hours without resolution auto-escalate to supervisors with immediate notifications.\n*   Biweekly KPI reports track onboarding time, first-contact resolution, and CSAT with automated validation against targets.\n*   Caching and retry logic ensure data consistency during CRM API latency, maintaining system reliability.\n\n**Future Process Flows**\n\n*   **Automated Onboarding Case Management:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customer submits onboarding request via web form\n        * 2. Case auto-created in CRM and synchronized to Okta and Segment within 15 minutes\n        * 3. Agent receives real-time alert and views case on personalized, role-based dashboard\n        * 4. Agent resolves case within first contact; status updates in real time\n        * 5. KPIs automatically updated and reported biweekly with performance validation\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. CRM API fails during sync; system retries up to 3 times with 5-minute intervals\n        * 2. Case remains unresolved past 72 hours; automatic escalation to supervisor triggered\n        * 3. Data inconsistency detected; validation workflow initiated with Platform Engineering\n\n![TO-BE Process Diagram](to-be_automated-onboarding-case-management_20251121_163334.svg)\n\n**5. Stakeholders & Personas**\n\n*   **Support Agent:** Frontline team member responsible for resolving onboarding cases within first contact; accesses real-time dashboards and escalation tools for assigned customer segments.\n*   **Supervisor:** Oversees active cases, monitors KPIs biweekly, and escalates cases exceeding 72 hours; has full visibility across all customer segments.\n*   **Platform Engineer:** Responsible for API integration, data pipeline reliability, caching logic, and system performance; ensures data consistency across Salesforce, Okta, and Segment.\n*   **Product Manager:** Validates use cases and ensures feature alignment with onboarding goals; collaborates with support and engineering teams.\n\n**6. Functional Requirements Overview**\nThe system enables real-time case creation, role-based access, automated escalation, and KPI tracking across integrated platforms to reduce onboarding time, improve resolution rates, and boost CSAT scores.\n\n**7. Non-Functional Requirements**\n\n*   Data synchronization between systems must occur every 15 minutes or less\n*   System must support 99.5% uptime during business hours\n*   Role-based access must be enforced with zero privilege escalation\n*   All KPIs must be reportable biweekly with historical tracking\n*   APIs must support retry logic and caching to handle latency up to 10 seconds\n\n**8.

Scope Boundaries:**\nThe project focuses on enhancing the self-service portal with role-based access, real-time integrations, and analytics to improve user satisfaction and reduce support load.\n\n*   **In-Scope:** ['Development and deployment of the self-service portal with four defined user personas', 'Integration with CoreBanking (real-time REST APIs), CRM (batch SFTP sync), and Identity Provider (OAuth 2.0)', 'Implementation of real-time dashboards for fraud alerts and transaction monitoring, with near-real-time updates for other metrics', 'Role-based access control (RBAC) with defined permissions per persona', 'Biweekly KPI tracking via dashboards for user satisfaction, support ticket reduction, and self-service adoption', 'Phased rollout with iterative validation and user testing']\n*   **Out-of-Scope:** ['Development of new backend systems outside of CoreBanking or CRM', 'Changes to third-party SLAs or data ownership agreements', 'Implementation of AI-driven support chatbots beyond basic self-service workflows']\n\n**3. Current State (As-Is)**\n\n*   Customers resolve account and transaction issues primarily via phone or email, leading to high support volume.\n*   CRM and analytics data are updated only once daily, causing delays in user insights and decision-making.\n*   Access controls are inconsistent, resulting in over-privileged accounts and frequent access-related support tickets.\n*   Support agents lack real-time data, often delaying resolution and increasing SLA breaches.\n*   No self-service tools exist for users to independently view transaction history or resolve common issues.\n\n**As-Is Process Flows**\n\n*   **Customer Support Request Submission:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customer contacts support via phone or email\n        * 2. Agent logs ticket in CRM\n        * 3. Ticket is assigned and resolved within 48 hours\n        * 4. Customer receives resolution notification\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Ticket misrouted due to poor categorization\n        * 2. Resolution delayed by lack of real-time data access\n        * 3. Customer escalates due to unresolved or repeated issues\n\n![AS-IS Process Diagram](diagrams/as-is_customer-support-request-submission_20251125_170216.svg)\n\n**4. Future State (To-Be)**\n\n*   Customers and advisors resolve 60% of issues independently via a secure, role-based self-service portal.\n*   Real-time dashboards deliver fraud alerts within 1 second and transaction insights within 5 minutes.\n*   Role-based access ensures accurate, secure data visibility with no over-privileged accounts.\n*   Support teams focus on complex cases, reducing ticket volume by 50% and improving SLA compliance.\n*   User satisfaction increases by 40% through faster, self-driven issue resolution and intuitive design.\n\n**Future Process Flows**\n\n*   **Self-Service Transaction Inquiry:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. User logs in via OAuth 2.0 with secure authentication\n        * 2. System fetches real-time account data via CoreBanking REST API\n        * 3. User views, filters, and searches transaction history instantly\n        * 4. Built-in help tool resolves query without ticket creation\n        * 5. System provides instant answer or guided next steps\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. API failure triggers fallback to cached data with visible warning\n        * 2. Permission denied for requested data—system guides user to contact advisor\n        * 3. Network outage prevents login; system logs error and notifies admin\n\n![TO-BE Process Diagram](diagrams/to-be_self-service-transaction-inquiry_20251125_170216.svg)\n\n**5. Stakeholders & Personas**\n\n*   **Retail Customer:** Individuals seeking account balance, transaction history, and basic support via self-service tools with limited access to personal data.\n*   **Small Business Owner:** Business users needing access to account summaries, transaction reports, and payment history with role-based permissions.\n*   **Financial Advisor:** Authorized personnel managing client accounts, viewing shared data, and initiating actions within defined scope.\n*   **Admin:** System administrators with full access to configuration, user management, and audit logs.\n\n**6. Functional Requirements Overview**\nThe self-service portal will support four user personas with role-based access, real-time data from CoreBanking, batch-synced CRM data, and secure authentication via OAuth 2.0. Real-time dashboards will track key metrics, with adoption and satisfaction monitored via analytics and surveys.\n\n**7. Non-Functional Requirements**\n\n*   Real-time data access for fraud alerts and transaction monitoring (within 1 second)\n*   Near-real-time updates (≤5 minutes) for other dashboard metrics\n*   Compliance with GDPR and CCPA for data privacy and user consent\n*   System availability of 99.5% during business hours\n*   Role-based access control enforced at all system levels\n\n**8. Assumptions**\n\n*   Third-party SLAs for CoreBanking and Identity Provider will be met\n*   Team availability remains stable throughout the project lifecycle\n*   Users will adopt self-service features once usability and reliability are proven\n*   Data ownership remains with FinServe for customer data and third parties for their own data\n*   Legacy system constraints will not prevent real-time integration\n\n**9. Risks**\n\n*   Delayed API delivery from CoreBanking team may delay launch by up to 3 weeks\n*   SLA breaches from third-party providers could impact real-time data availability\n*   Low user adoption due to poor UX or lack of training\n*   Data privacy violations due to misconfigured access controls\n*   Budget constraints may limit scope expansion or testing resources\n\n**10. Open Issues**\n\n*   Final agreement on data refresh frequency for non-critical metrics (real-time vs. near-real-time)\n*   Clarification on responsibility for resolving access errors in the Identity Provider\n*   Need for formal sign-off from Compliance team before launch\n*   Definition of 'real-time' for FR-5 must be formally agreed upon with technical team\n*   Validation process for role permissions during user testing is still being refined\n\n**11. Functional Requirements**\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n| Spec ID | Specification Description | Business Rules/Data Dependency |\n|---|---|---|\n| FR-1 | The system shall authenticate users via OAuth 2.0 with the Identity Provider, ensuring secure and compliant access to the self-service portal. | Authentication must comply with OAuth 2.0 standards; session tokens expire after 15 minutes of inactivity. |\n| FR-2 | The system shall retrieve real-time account data from CoreBanking using REST APIs for Retail Customers and Small Business Owners. | Data refresh frequency must be ≤1 second for high-priority actions like transaction monitoring; failure triggers fallback to cached data with warning. |\n| FR-3 | The system shall sync customer history data from CRM via SFTP every 24 hours, with integrity validation and error logging. | Data sync must complete within 2 hours; failed transfers must be retried up to 3 times before alerting the admin. |\n| FR-4 | The system shall enforce role-based access control (RBAC) with defined permissions per persona, including Admin, Financial Advisor, Small Business Owner, and Retail Customer. | Access levels must be tested in every sprint; role permissions cannot be overridden without audit trail. |\n| FR-5 | The system shall provide real-time dashboards for fraud alerts and transaction monitoring, with near-real-time updates (≤5 minutes) for other metrics. | Real-time data must be delivered within 1 second; near-real-time data must be updated within 5 minutes; data refresh frequency must be documented and validated in the risk register. |\n| FR-6 | The system shall track and report KPIs including user satisfaction (survey), support ticket reduction, and self-service adoption via in-app analytics and CRM integration. | KPIs must be updated biweekly in shared dashboards; deviations must trigger root-cause analysis and stakeholder review. |", "subject": "Functional Specification", "q_index": 45, "timestamp": "2025-11-25T17:02:18.212670Z"}

Scope Boundaries:**\nImplement core digital onboarding with KYC validation, OCR capture, audit logging, and payment initiation while excluding legacy paper processes and additional regulatory checks.\n\n*   **In-Scope:** - Core personal and SME onboarding flows\n- Real‑time KYC API integration (v3.1)\n- OCR data capture via Tesseract‑cloud (v2.0)\n- Audit log sync with compliance portal (REST‑JSON, mutual TLS)\n- Payment gateway integration for initial deposits (v4.5)\n- 99.9% data accuracy validation layer\n- KPI dashboards and reporting\n*   **Out-of-Scope:** - Manual approval workarounds\n- Legacy paper‑based forms\n- Additional regulatory checks beyond current KYC scope\n- Non‑core customer support portals\n\n**3. Current State (As-Is)**\n\n*   Customers submit paper forms that are scanned into a legacy system.\n*   Back‑office tellers manually enter data into Excel and verify documents in a separate portal.\n*   Manual cross‑checks create delays of 3–5 days and increase audit risk.\n\n**As-Is Process Flows**\n\n*   **Paper Form Intake:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customer fills paper form.\n        * 2. Form is scanned into legacy system.\n        * 3. Data is manually entered by teller into Excel.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Scanning errors lead to data loss.\n        * 2. Manual entry introduces typos and delays.\n*   **Document Verification:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Compliance officer logs into legacy portal.\n        * 2. Documents are manually verified.\n        * 3. Verification status is recorded.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Portal downtime prevents verification.\n        * 2. Manual errors cause audit flags.\n\n![AS-IS Process Diagram](diagrams/as-is_paper-form-intake_20251126_143530.svg)\n\n![AS-IS Process Diagram](diagrams/as-is_document-verification_20251126_143530.svg)\n\n**4.

Customer enters personal data in web form.\n        * 2. Data is sent to KYC API (v3.1) via OAuth 2.0.\n        * 3. KYC response and confidence score are returned instantly.\n        * 4. OCR service parses uploaded documents into XML.\n        * 5. Validation layer checks accuracy against 99.9% threshold.\n        * 6. Audit log payload is posted to compliance portal over mutual TLS.\n        * 7. Payment gateway processes initial deposit with HMAC‑SHA256 signature.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. KYC API fails; fallback OCR captures data and queues request in Azure Service Bus.\n        * 2. OCR returns errors; user is prompted for manual correction.\n        * 3. Compliance portal timeout; retry logic triggers within SLA.\n        * 4. Payment gateway error; transaction is flagged for manual review.\n\n![TO-BE Process Diagram](diagrams/to-be_digital-onboarding-flow_20251126_143530.svg)\n\n**5. Stakeholders & Personas**\n\n*   **Customer:** End‑user seeking a fast, frictionless account opening experience with instant status updates.\n*   **Teller:** Back‑office staff who quickly verifies KYC status and flags exceptions in a secure sandbox.\n*   **Compliance Officer:** Regulatory specialist requiring immutable audit logs and real‑time alerts on compliance breaches.\n\n**6.
