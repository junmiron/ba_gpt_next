Customer submits a ticket via the self-service portal.\n        * 2. The system checks for duplicate tickets based on key validations.\n        * 3. Requests are categorized automatically by type and priority.\n        * 4. Support team is notified only if manual intervention is needed.\n        * 5. Tickets resolved automatically in the system are closed promptly.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Missing or incomplete data prevents accurate ticket categorization.\n        * 2. Duplicate tickets occur due to system misconfiguration during integration.\n*   **Automated Sales Report Generation:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Salesforce and Power BI data are synchronized in real time.\n        * 2. The portal consolidates data per defined business rules.\n        * 3. Reports with key metrics are generated automatically.\n        * 4. Reports are distributed electronically to relevant managers.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Partial data synchronization results in incomplete reports.\n        * 2. Regional data retention rules cause delays in report generation.\n*   **Elimination of Process Redundancies:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. System identifies and flags duplicate workflows across business units.\n        * 2. Affected processes are streamlined based on defined rules.\n        * 3.

Current State (As-Is)**\n\n*   Customers face fragmented systems requiring multiple logins and inconsistent interfaces.\n*   Manual processes like email communications dominate support issue resolution.\n*   Critical systems (CRM, ERP, payment gateway) lack real-time data synchronization.\n*   Frequent reliance on customer support due to limited self-service capabilities.\n*   Billing systems operate in isolation, causing viewing and payment delays.\n\n**As-Is Process Flows**\n\n*   **Service Tracking and Support:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customer submits a support query via a legacy system.\n        * 2. Support staff retrieves the query manually from backend systems.\n        * 3. Resolution details are sent back to the customer via email.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Queries are delayed due to system issues or high workloads.\n        * 2. Customers must follow up multiple times, leading to frustration.\n*   **Billing Management:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customers access bills on a separate billing portal.\n        * 2. Payments are made using a standalone third-party payment system.\n        * 3. Email confirmation is sent after successful payment.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Billing system errors prevent access to invoices or payments.\n        * 2. Payment confirmation emails are delayed, creating confusion.\n\n![AS-IS Process Diagram](diagrams\\as-is_service-tracking-and-support_20251224_154237.svg)\n\n![AS-IS Process Diagram](diagrams\\as-is_billing-management_20251224_154237.svg)\n\n**4.

Customer logs into the portal and submits a detailed support query.\n        * 2. The query automatically creates a ticket in the CRM support queue.\n        * 3. Customer receives real-time status updates within the portal.\n        * 4. Support agent resolves the ticket and provides closure confirmation.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1. Incomplete query details delay CRM ticket creation, requiring user follow-up.\n        * 2. System issues prevent real-time updates; support must provide email updates.\n        * 3. Ticket resolution is delayed due to misrouted or incomplete information.\n*   **Billing Management:**\n    * Happy path:\n        * 1. Customer accesses the billing dashboard within the portal.\n        * 2. Invoices are displayed with current and historical data for review.\n        * 3. Customer completes payment using the integrated, secure payment gateway.\n        * 4. Instant payment confirmation is displayed in the portal and emailed.\n    * Unhappy path / exceptions:\n        * 1.
